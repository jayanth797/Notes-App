# 🚀 Project Overview

The Notes App allows users to:

* Create notes
* View saved notes
* Update notes
* Delete notes
* Manage notes efficiently through a clean UI

The repository is structured into **two main parts**:

| Directory | Description                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| `client`  | Next.js frontend application |
| `server`  | Node.js backend API          |

This separation helps maintain a scalable **frontend-backend architecture** similar to production-grade applications.
